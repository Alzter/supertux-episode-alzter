-Mission in Antartica!

	Alzter was relaxing at home on a
	cold, snowy winter's day, when
	suddenly the phone rang. Reluctantly,
	Alzter picked up the phone.

"Hello Alzter, this is Dr. Streah.
You're needed for an urgent mission
in Antartica. An anomaly has been
detected, snowballs and ice blocks
have become sentient and are walking
all over an Icy Island!"

	"What?!" Alzter responded.
	"I know it's my job to tackle these
	sorts of strange situations, but
	you know I hate cold environments!"

"This is an emergency!"
	Dr. Streah exclaimed.

"We're currently under-staffed and
these walking snow creatures are
multiplying by the minute! You
are our only agent strong enough
to take care of the threat."

	"Fine." Alzter moaned.
	"I'll go check out the Icy Island
	you speak of, and find the source
	of these so-called snow creatures."

	Alzter went to Dr. Streah's lab and
	was transported to the Icy Island,
	ready to take on whatever threat was
	waiting for him.
