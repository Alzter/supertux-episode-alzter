-Inside the mysterious castle...

	Alzter had explored every inch of
	the Icy Island, eventually finding
	himself inside a giant castle
	surrounded by statues. The statues
	read out "Nolok", and Alzter swiftly
	realized this must've been the person
	responsible for all the walking snow
	creatures.

	While he couldn't find Nolok himself,
	Alzter did find a giant machine
	hidden in one of the secret castle
	rooms. It was huge, with giant tubes
	coming out of it sucking up all the
	snow and ice from the island and
	turning it into walking creatures!

	Alzter saw the machine and
	immideately realized what he must do.
	He used brute force to smash down the
	machine, leaving only rubble where it
	once stood. After this he called
	Dr. Streah.

	"I did it!" Alzter said. "I found
	the machine responsible for all the
	walking snowballs and smashed it!
	It seems to be tied to a guy called
	Nolok but I couldn't find any trace
	of him in the castle I found the
	machine in."

"Well done, Alzter..."
	Dr. Streah replied.

"But you're not off the
hook just yet, there's even MORE
walking creatures, we found a
case of walking leaves and evil
snails inhabiting a forest!"

	"Not again!" Alzter cried. He would
	have to now tackle this mysterious
	forest, but all he wanted to do was
	go home.

	But not all hope was lost! He got
	to at least take a break first,
	before preparing for the treacherous
	journey that was before him...
